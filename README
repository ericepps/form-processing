This is a combination of my form validation and processing scripts. It consists of 
the following actions:
 * validate form data both client- and server-side
 * process form data and send it to any/all of:
    - send to an e-mail address
	- store in a delimited file
	- a FileBound E-Form
	- upload attached files to a specified directory
	- send a notification e-mail
	
File Descriptions:
 * js/formValidate.js - Client-side validation
 * php/formValidation.php - Should be included above the head of the form page (or 
     page the form recirects to). All other PHP files are included from this page.
	 Debugging mode can be turned on/off on this page as well.
 * php/formDefaults.php - All defaults (default e-mail addresses, SMTP servers, paths,
     etc.) are stored in this file.
 * php/form2Delimited.php - Stores form data as a delimited file.
 * php/form2EForm.php - Stores form data as FileBound E-Form.
 * php/form2e-mail.php - Sends form data as an HTML e-mail.
 * php/formAttachedFiles.php - Processes uploaded files and stores them in a specified directory.
 * php/forme-mailNotify.php - Sends a notification e-mail to specified e-mail address(es).


What's Missing:
 * HTML Snippets and documentation for how to structure forms for use with these scripts
 * Default basic CSS styles
